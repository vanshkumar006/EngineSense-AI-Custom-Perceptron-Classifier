# EngineSense-AI-Custom-Perceptron-Classifier
A from-scratch Perceptron ML Classifier. Built with Python &amp; NumPy to predict engine quality (Pass/Fail) through manual weight optimization. Achieved convergence in just 2 epochs (Final Weights: [9.2, -5.23, 5.56]). Features dynamic decision boundary visualization using Seaborn. Demonstrates the math behind linear separation.
